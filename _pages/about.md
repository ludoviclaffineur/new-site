I am an enthusiastic Belgian who loves to build and create things by empowering teams.

## Background
I studied software engineering at I.S.I.B. in Brussels in 2013 and my first work experience was a 2 year R&D project in the field of network sonification [Laras](http://laras.be). The main goal was to create sounds from network packets in order to have a direct audio picture of what's happening on the network infrastructure (more to come soon).

In September 2015 I started work for [Odoo](https://odoo.com) as a client solution developer where I was responsible to develop and ship customisations for the customers. I learnt the practices to develop what was needed and only focus on what really matters for the client -- The excellence of services lies in our capacity to deliver quality fast and I truly believe that business analysis and client management are key to achieve that.

In September 2017 I got the opportunity to join at [Skipr](https://skipr.co) as developer in order to build an app that would enable everyone to move everywhere. We built a product from scratch with all the validation of intermediate steps. We went from 1 to 40 people in two years and are live in Belgium and ready to spread in Europe. My job was to support our development team to achieve our goals in any matter -- processes, code quality, architecture and people management.

It's been awhile that I wanted to start writing about experiences and learnings to share with a broader community so I hope you will find some interesting readings and don't hesitate to contact me
